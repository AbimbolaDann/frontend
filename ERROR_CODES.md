# Error Codes

This document explains the frontend error codes handled by
`src/lib/errorMessages.ts`, plus the API codes the frontend may receive from the
Heliobond backend.

## Frontend Codes

| Code | Meaning | Suggested action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `insufficient_balance` | Wallet balance is too low for the requested amount. | Use a smaller amount or fund the wallet. |
| `insufficient_funds` | Alias for an insufficient wallet balance. | Use a smaller amount or fund the wallet. |
| `amount_too_low` | Deposit or withdrawal amount is below the minimum. | Enter at least the displayed minimum amount. |
| `amount_exceeds_balance` | Requested amount is greater than the available balance. | Use Max or enter a smaller amount. |
| `invalid_amount` | Amount input could not be parsed as a valid number. | Re-enter the amount using numeric characters. |
| `wallet_not_connected` | A wallet-only action was attempted without an active wallet session. | Connect a wallet and retry. |
| `timeout` | A network, wallet, or transaction confirmation request timed out. | Retry after checking network connectivity. |
| `network_error` | The frontend could not reach the API, RPC, or wallet provider. | Check connectivity and retry. |
| `simulation_failed` | Soroban transaction simulation failed before submission. | Retry; if it repeats, inspect the contract/RPC response. |
| `tx_failed` | Submitted transaction failed or was rejected. | Review wallet details and retry. |

## API Codes

The backend documents API responses as
`{ "error": { "code": "<code>", "message": "<detail>" } }`. Common codes are:

| Code | Meaning | Suggested action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bad_request` | Request parameters or body failed validation. | Fix the request input shown in the message. |
| `unauthorized` | Missing or invalid admin/API bearer token. | Provide the expected token for protected routes. |
| `not_found` | Route or resource was not found. | Confirm the route and resource identifier. |
| `too_many_requests` | Rate limit exceeded. | Wait for the `Retry-After` window before retrying. |
| `payload_too_large` | Request body exceeded the configured size limit. | Reduce payload size. |
| `server_misconfigured` | Backend is missing required server-side configuration. | Configure the backend environment before retrying. |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Unexpected backend exception. | Check server logs; do not expose stack traces to users. |

## Opaque `ERR_###` Codes

Codes such as `ERR_008` are not currently defined by the frontend mapper. Treat
them as backend, wallet, protocol, or provider-specific codes until their source
is identified.

When adding a new `ERR_###` code, update this file and add a mapping in
`src/lib/errorMessages.ts` so users see a friendly message instead of the raw
identifier.
